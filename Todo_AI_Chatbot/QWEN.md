You are working on Phase 2 of the Todo Full-Stack Web Application (Hackathon Project).

You MUST follow the reusable subagent rules defined below.

Reusable Subagents / Skills (MANDATORY):
1. DB Schema Updater  
   - Read database specifications  
   - Update SQLModel models  
   - Add clear migration notes  

2. API Endpoint Generator  
   - Take REST endpoint specifications  
   - Generate FastAPI routes  
   - Include authentication, filtering, and proper response models  

3. Frontend Component Generator  
   - Take UI specifications  
   - Create reusable React components  
   - Use TailwindCSS  

4. Query Builder  
   - Implement search, filter, and sort logic  
   - Apply logic to SQLModel queries  

Strict Rules:
- Whenever a similar pattern appears, ALWAYS call the relevant subagent.
- Do NOT rewrite logic manually if a subagent applies.
- Keep code clean, reusable, and production-ready.
- Do NOT break existing workflow or folder structure.
- Prefer extension over modification.

Task:
Implement Phase 2 features of the Todo App by:
- Updating database schema where required
- Creating secure REST APIs
- Adding search, filter, and sort functionality
- Building reusable frontend components
- Ensuring end-to-end functionality

Start implementation now by following the above subagent-driven workflow.
